#. Description of the plugin/theme
msgid "Quality is a perfect theme to create a corporate/business website. It boasts 3 beautifully designed page templates, namely Business Page, Full-width, and Blog. Quality is built on the Bootstrap CSS Framework, which makes it fully responsive on all devices, and is translation-ready. To enable the Business template, just create a normal WordPress page and select Business Template as page template. The Business template can be further personalized in the customizer. Each section in the Business Template is designed according to current business requirements, with sections like Banner, Services, Projects etc. You can use this theme for any type of activity. Quality supports famous plugins like Contact Form 7, to create your contact page or any type of forms you might want to add. Quality also gives a clean and appealing look to the WordPress core gallery feature. See Quality's demo at http://webriti.com/quality-free"
